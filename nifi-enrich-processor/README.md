# WURFL Microservice processor for Apache Nifi (under developement)

This project provides an example of an Apache Nifi Processor that enriches a NiFi Flow file with WURFL device detection data

The processor will receive content from a flow file in form of JSON formatted HTTP request data and return it enriched with WURFL capabilities data, obtained by a running
instance of WURFL Microservice.
